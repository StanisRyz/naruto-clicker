# Naruto Clicker

Naruto Clicker is a vertical idle/clicker game prototype for Yandex Games.

## Status

Early setup/prototype. The project currently has a basic playable clicker loop and a YandexBridge autoload as a future integration point.

Save systems, heroes, settlement features, and monetization are intentionally not implemented yet.

## Project Details

- Engine: Godot 4.5.1
- Language: GDScript
- Target platform: Web / Yandex Games
- Orientation: vertical / portrait
- Viewport: 720x1280
- Renderer: GL Compatibility

## Local Development

Open the project in Godot 4.5.1 and run the main scene from the editor. Keep changes small and verify the scene still opens and runs after each patch.

Do not add external plugins or external assets without explicit approval.

## Current Gameplay Prototype

The main scene contains the first local clicker loop:

- Tap/click the main game field to damage the current enemy.
- Enemy HP is shown with a label and progress bar.
- Each level requires defeating 10 enemies.
- Enemy HP and gold reward scale with the current level.
- Gold can buy a single damage upgrade that increases click damage.

The prototype state and formulas live in `scripts/game/ClickerState.gd`. `scenes/game/ClickerScreen.gd` owns the gameplay flow and updates the UI components.

## Web Export Notes

The project is intended for Yandex Games Web export. Keep the 720x1280 portrait setup, GL Compatibility renderer, and Web-friendly Control-based UI layout.

YandexBridge is present for future platform integration, but ads, payments, saves, cloud features, and authentication should not be added until explicitly requested.
